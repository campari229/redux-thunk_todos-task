- [Basic markup](https://mate-academy.github.io/redux-thunk_todos-task/)
  
## Workflow
- Fork the repository with task
- Clone forked repository 
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<user_name>/<task_repository>.git
    ```
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Then develop

## Development mode 
- Run `npm start` to start development server on `http://localhost:3000`
    When you run server the command line window will no longer be available for 
    writing commands until you stop server (`ctrl + c`). All other commands you 
    need to run in new command line window.
- Follow [HTML, CSS styleguide](https://mate-academy.github.io/style-guides/htmlcss.html)
- Follow [the simplified JS styleguide](https://mate-academy.github.io/style-guides/javascript-standard-modified)
- run `npm run lint` to check code style
- When you finished add correct `homepage` to `package.json` and run `npm run deploy` 
- Add links to your demo in readme.md.
  - `[DEMO LINK](https://campari229.github.io/redux-thunk_todos-task/)` - this will be a 
  link to your index.html
- Commit and push all recent changes.
- Create `Pull Request` from forked repo `(<branch_name>)` to original repo 
(`master`).
- Add a link at `PR` to Google Spreadsheets.
